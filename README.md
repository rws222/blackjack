# Blackjack Web App

A Blackjack web app demo of an assignment from my CSE 264 - Web Systems Programming course.

As part of my Web Systems Programming (CSE 264) course in the fall semester 
of 2020, my classmates and I were tasked with building a Blackjack web application. 
The assignment was a test of our understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and 
required us to use a Deck of Cards API to manage the deck, animations for the 
cards, and an opponent that operated based on a set of rules given by the professor. 
The full web app version can be found in my CS Classwork repository on GitHub, which 
is also linked to the "Projects" section of my website. The link below goes to a 
reduced-code, fully functional demo of the game. Enjoy!
